What do you think of diff?
	if there are many lines of code, diff displays the part that was changed
	by showing the difference in the line that was changed.

How cou
ld having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?
	You could go back and see your improvement and changes in code you have made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like google docs does?
	When you choose to commit, you have a reason for saving the file, whether it be a big change, or 
	before you try something new. Con is you could forget to save.
	
	When things are saved automatically, it could be in the middle of a change and that version will not 
	make any sense. A pro is that you would never lose all your work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file seperately?
	Git saves related files while google docs seperate files are most 
	likely unrelated, and changes in one 	wont impact the other one.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	Git log shows all the different versions while git diff can compare 
	the versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	You would know that if something goes wrong you can easily to back to a previous state when you know the code was working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	Keeping track of versions of future apps i will develop.
