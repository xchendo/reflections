What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you init a repo, it adds a hidden folder, .git which stores meta 
	data which holds onto different versions of your project when you make
	a commit. You need to do this or else your files won't have a log and 
	the only file you will have access to is the current one.
