What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you init a repo, it adds a hidden folder, .git which stores meta 
	data which holds onto different versions of your project when you make
	a commit. You need to do this or else your files won't have a log and 
	the only file you will have access to is the current one.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
	By using git diff to compare it to the last commit, or to see what 
	changes are in this commit in the staging area.
