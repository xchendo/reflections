Why would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?
  So you can have multiple people working on a project and also be able to access the project from places besides your own computer.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a clone from github as your own repo on github, a clone is a copy on a repo from a remote repo to
	your local computer, and a branch is a copy of your existing project seperate from the master branch. You 
	would use one depending on where you are making the copy from.
