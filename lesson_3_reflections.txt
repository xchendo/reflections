Why would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?
  So you can have multiple people working on a project and also be able to access the project from places besides your own computer.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because maybe someone will add a change to the project that you arent ready to introduce into your project yet.
