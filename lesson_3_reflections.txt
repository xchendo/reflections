Why would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?
  So you can have multiple people working on a project and also be able to access the project from places besides your own computer.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because maybe someone will add a change to the project that you arent ready to introduce into your project yet.

What is the a fork, clone, and a branch? When should you use each?
   A fork is a clone from github to your profile on github, a clone is a copy of a repo from an onlile soource to 
   your local computer, and a branch is a copy of your project off the master branch where changes can me made 
   without affecting the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It is useful if you want to see the original state compared to the changes made.
